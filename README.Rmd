The goal of practices.demo is to ...

## Installation

You can install the released version of practices.demo from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("practices.demo")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/practices.demo")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(practices.demo)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

1. Changes you share should be closely related
2. Commit often
3. The work you share should be complete
4. Test before you commit
5. Structure commit messages like an email
6. Agree on a workflow
7. Use tools to be more productive
